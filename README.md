## Inspiration

Inspired by the _Las Vegas shooting_, our team decided to have a deep  research into  the terrorism cases in the past few decades and have a more detailed information summary of each incident. By filtering down from different datasets, our project chooses to use the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) as our data resource which includes information on over 170,350 domestic and international terrorist attacks from 1970 to 2016.  

## To Audience

The majority audiences of this project are the authorities. In particular, we want this project to be useful for people who work in security departments. By visualizing the _GTD_, with the analysis and summaries in this project, hopefully people can have a better idea in predicting terrorism incidents and have stronger security checks over areas, so that these cases can be prevented as much as possible.

## How To Use Our APP

In this project, we decided to use shiny as our tool. The location of all the terrorism cases will be shown as a pin point one the map. By zooming in and out the scale of map, it could show the location from a nation to a specific street or neighborhood of the selected case. By placing the mouse onto the selected pin point, an information box with detailed information will be shown which can give audiences a better idea of which kind of terrorism attack, what weapons are used, who are the target groups, and motives of this terrorist. Base on how the pin points spread on the map and density, it is easier for audiences, to be specific, the authorities, to make a quick and accurate decision on which part needs to strengthen their security protection.

By choosing a country in the first selecting box,the plot will show the frequency of terrorism events over years in a specific country . Then the user can feel  free to choose one of the  years in the second box.As a result,the time ,location , attack type,weapon type and target type of each event will be displayed in a table format.
